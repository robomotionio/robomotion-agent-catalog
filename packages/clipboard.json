      "howItWorks": "The Get From Clipboard node performs the following steps: 1. **Accesses System Clipboard** - Connects to the operating system's clipboard service 2. **Reads Clipboard Content** - Retrieves the current text content stored in the clipboard 3. **Converts to String** - Ensures the clipboard data is in string format 4. **Outputs Data** - Returns the clipboard content through the Clipboard Data output property 5. **Handles Empty Clipboard** - If clipboard is empty, returns an empty string",
      "usage": [
        "**Clipboard Access** - The automation must have permission to access the system clipboard",
        "**Desktop Environment** - Must run in an environment with clipboard support (desktop automation, not server-only)",
