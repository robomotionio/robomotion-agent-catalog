For pure compression formats (Gzip, Bzip2, etc.), wraps the content in a tar archive to preserve filenames and directory structure 5. Saves the compressed file to the target path",

Leaves the archive file unchanged This is much more efficient than extracting the entire archive when you only need one or a few specific files.",
