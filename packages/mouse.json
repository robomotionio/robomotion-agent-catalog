The execution follows these steps: 1. **Delay Before** - Waits for the specified delay before execution (if configured) 2. **Button Type Validation** - Validates that the mouse button type is one of: left, center, or right 3. **Coordinate Retrieval** - Retrieves the X and Y coordinates from input variables 4. **Coordinate Validation** - Ensures X and Y are non-negative values 5. **Mouse Movement** - Moves the mouse to the specified coordinates (if X \u003e 0 or Y \u003e 0) - If both X and Y are 0, clicks at the current mouse position without moving 6. **Key Modifier Press** - If a key modifier is specified, holds down that key 7. **Click Execution** - Performs the click based on the click type: - Single-click: One click with the specified button - Double-click: Two rapid clicks with the specified button - Button-press/Press-down: Holds the button down without releasing - Button-release/Press-release: Releases a held button 8. **Key Modifier Release** - Releases any key modifier that was pressed 9. **Delay After** - Waits for the specified delay after execution (if configured)",
