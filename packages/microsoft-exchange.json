Loads full email properties including sender, recipients, subject, body, and attachments 6. Optionally marks emails as read if \"Mark as Read\" is enabled 7. Returns list of mail objects with all metadata 8. Implements automatic retry logic for transient errors (3 attempts with exponential backoff) :::note The node uses a 100-second timeout for Exchange operations and implements robust error handling for connection issues, server throttling, and temporary failures. :::"

Downloads each attachment's content from Exchange Server 7. Handles filename conflicts by appending numbers (e.g., `file_1.pdf`, `file_2.pdf`) 8. Saves each attachment to the specified directory 9. Returns a list of all saved file paths 10. Implements automatic retry logic for transient errors (3 attempts with exponential backoff) :::note The node uses a 100-second timeout for Exchange operations. Files with duplicate names are automatically renamed with numeric suffixes to avoid overwriting existing files.

Attaches files if provided (validates file existence) 6. Sets body type (HTML or plain text) 7. Sends the email or saves to Sent Items based on \"Save Copy\" option 8.
