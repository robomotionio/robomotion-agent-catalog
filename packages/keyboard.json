      "howItWorks": "The Send Keys node simulates keyboard input by sending keystrokes to the currently active window on your desktop. The execution follows these steps: 1. **Delay Before** - Waits for the specified delay before execution (if configured) 2. **Modifier Validation** - Validates each key modifier (1, 2, and 3) against the list of supported keys 3. **Key Normalization** - Converts certain modifiers to their standard forms (e.g., \"control\" to \"ctrl\", \"win\" to \"cmd\") 4. **Key Press Simulation** - Uses the robotgo library to simulate the key press: - If a key is provided with modifiers, presses the modifiers + key combination - If only a key is provided, presses that single key - If only modifiers are provided, presses the modifier keys in order 5. **Delay After** - Waits for the specified delay after execution (if configured) The order of key presses is important: Modifier 1, then Modifier 2, then Modifier 3, followed by the Key input.",

        "**Empty Key** - You can leave the Key field empty to press only modifier keys (e.g., just pressing Enter or Escape)",
        "**Platform Differences** - \"Win\" modifier maps to \"Command\" on macOS and Windows key on Windows/Linux",
        "**Focus Required** - The keystrokes are sent to whichever window is currently active, so ensure proper window activation before this node"
