      "howItWorks": "The Add Webhook Subscription node configures Calendly to send HTTP POST requests to your specified endpoint whenever monitored events occur. This enables real-time automation based on Calendly activity. When executed, the node: 1. Uses either the Client ID from Connect or direct credentials 2. Validates the webhook URL and organization URL 3. Configures the event types to monitor (create, cancel, or both) 4. Makes a POST request to `/webhook_subscriptions` endpoint 5. Returns the webhook subscription details including the subscription ID",
      "usage": [

When executed, the node: 1. Retrieves your Calendly API token from the provided credentials 2. Creates an authenticated HTTP client with the authorization header 3. Validates the credentials by making a test request to the `/users/me` endpoint 4. Returns a unique Client ID that references the authenticated connection 5. This Client ID is then used by other Calendly nodes to make API calls",
