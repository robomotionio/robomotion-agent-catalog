      "howItWorks": "The Send Mail node sends emails through SMTP with support for various features. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. **Authentication Selection** - Uses either Client ID from Connect node or direct credentials 2. **Recipient Validation** - Ensures at least one recipient is specified (To, CC, or BCC) 3. **Email Construction** - Builds the email with headers, body, and attachments 4. **Attachment Processing** - Attaches files from specified paths, supporting embedded images 5. **Reply/Forward Handling** - If in reply/replyall/forward mode, fetches original email and constructs proper headers 6. **SMTP Connection** - Connects to SMTP server using Basic Auth or OAuth2 7. **Email Transmission** - Sends the email through the SMTP server 8. **Threading Headers** - Adds In-Reply-To and References headers for email threading",

        "**Embedded Images**: Images can be embedded in HTML emails using Content-ID references",

        "**Quote Styles**: Choose between `gmail`, `outlook`, or `simple` quoting formats",
        "**Attachment Paths**: Must be absolute paths accessible from the robot's machine",
        "**OAuth2 vs Basic**: Both authentication methods work transparently",
        "**SMTP Ports**: Port 587 (STARTTLS) or 465 (SSL) are standard",
        "**BCC Privacy**: BCC recipients are hidden from other recipients"
