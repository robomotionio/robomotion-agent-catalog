  "summary": "The Tesseract OCR package provides optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities for extracting text from images. Built on Google's Tesseract engine, this package enables you to convert image-based text into machine-readable text, supporting over 100 languages.",

      "summary": "Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Supports both image file paths and base64-encoded image data with multi-language support.",
      "howItWorks": "The Image To Text node extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR technology. When executed, the node: 1. Validates that Tesseract is installed and available in the system PATH 2. Determines which input source to use (Image Path or Base64 Data) 3. For base64 input: - Decodes the base64 string to an image - Overlays the image on a white background for better OCR accuracy - Processes the image with Tesseract 4. For file path input: - Reads the image file using OpenCV - Converts the image to grayscale for improved OCR performance - Saves a temporary processed image - Processes the image with Tesseract - Cleans up the temporary file 5. Returns the extracted text with leading and trailing whitespace removed",
      "usage": [
        "Tesseract OCR must be installed on the system and available in PATH",
        "Valid image file (for Image Path input) in supported formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, TIFF, etc.)",
        "Valid base64-encoded image data (for Base64 Data input)",
        "Language data files must be installed for the selected language"
      ],
      "bestPractices": [
        "**Image Quality:** Higher resolution images with clear text produce better results",
        "**Image Preprocessing:** The node automatically converts images to grayscale for better OCR accuracy",
        "**White Background:** For base64 images, the node overlays on a white background to improve text recognition",
        "**Language Selection:** Choose the correct language for best results. Using the wrong language will result in poor text extraction",
        "**Multi-Language Support:** Use the Advanced Language option to process documents with multiple languages",
        "**File Formats:** Supports common image formats including PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, and more",
        "**Temporary Files:** When using Image Path, the node creates a temporary grayscale image that is automatically cleaned up after processing",
        "**Whitespace Handling:** Extracted text is automatically trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace"
