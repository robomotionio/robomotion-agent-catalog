Retrieves the API key from the provided credentials 2. Creates a base HTTP request with proper authentication headers (Basic Auth) 3. Validates the credentials by making a test request to the Lemlist team endpoint 4. If authentication succeeds, stores the authenticated request in memory 5. Returns a unique Client ID that references this authenticated session The Client ID can then be passed to other Lemlist nodes to perform operations without re-authenticating each time.",
