Validates the provided text input 2. Retrieves Google Cloud credentials from the credentials option 3. Creates a Natural Language API client with the provided credentials 4. Performs the selected type of analysis on the text: * **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines the emotional tone of the text (positive, negative, neutral) * **Entity Analysis:** Extracts entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) and their metadata * **Entity Sentiment Analysis:** Combines entity extraction with sentiment analysis for each entity * **Syntactic Analysis:** Analyzes the grammatical structure of the text * **Content Classification:** Classifies the content into categories 5. Returns the structured analysis results",
