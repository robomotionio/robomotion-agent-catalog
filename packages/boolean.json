      "summary": "Assigns a boolean value (true or false) to a variable with a specified scope, making it available for use in other parts of your automation flow.",
      "howItWorks": "When executed, the Assign node: 1. Retrieves the boolean value from the specified input source 2. Applies thread-safe locking if using Global or Flow scope to prevent race conditions 3. Stores the boolean value in the output variable with the configured scope 4. Makes the value available for use by subsequent nodes"

Iterates through remaining values, applying the selected operation type 4. Stores the final result in the output variable **Processing Example (AND operation):** ``` Values: [true, true, false, true] Step 1: result = true (first value) Step 2: result = true AND true = true Step 3: result = true AND false = false Step 4: result = false AND true = false Final: result = false ```"
