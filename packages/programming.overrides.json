        "Variables accessed via `local`, `global`, and `flow` APIs are automatically serialized to JSON",
        "Returning `null` for single output will still generate an error - return the msg object instead",
        "For multiple outputs, use `null` in array positions where no message should be sent",
        "The script timeout cannot be disabled - always configure an appropriate timeout value",
        "Large objects or complex computations may impact performance - consider timeout accordingly",

        "Example edges: [[\"process-node-id\"], [\"done-node-id\"]] - first array = loop, second = completion",
        "The flow **must** loop back to the For Each input - forgetting this will cause the loop to execute only once",
        "The top port is used for iteration; the bottom port is only triggered when the loop completes",
        "Each For Each node maintains its own independent loop context via a unique scope ID",
        "Nested For Each loops are fully supported - each maintains separate iteration state",
        "The current index is zero-based (starts at 0) and is logged as \"iteration [1/n]\" for readability",
        "Empty arrays will immediately exit through the bottom port without executing the top port",

        "RIGHT: 3 conditions with 3 edges: [[\"node-a\"], [\"node-b\"], [\"node-c\"]]",
        "If all conditions point to same node, still use separate edges: [[\"same-id\"], [\"same-id\"], [\"same-id\"]]",
        "Conditions are evaluated in order from top to bottom (Output 1, then Output 2, etc.)",
        "With Break enabled, only the first matching condition triggers - ideal for if/else-if/else logic",
        "Without Break, multiple outputs can fire - useful for triggering multiple parallel actions",
        "Use `true` as the last condition for a default/\"else\" case (works best with Break enabled)",
