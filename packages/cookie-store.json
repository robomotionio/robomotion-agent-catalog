Retrieves the AES decryption key from credentials 4. Decrypts the file data using AES-CBC 5. Parses the decrypted JSON data into cookie objects 6. Stores the cookies in the message scope for use by other nodes",

        "Cookie expiration is based on the original expiration time when they were saved",
