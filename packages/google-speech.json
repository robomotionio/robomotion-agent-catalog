Configures recognition parameters: - Sets audio encoding to LINEAR16 (WAV format) - Applies specified sample rate and language code - Selects the appropriate recognition model - Enables requested features (punctuation, word offsets) 4. Submits long-running recognition request to Google Cloud 5. Waits for recognition operation to complete 6. Returns detailed transcription results with metadata",
